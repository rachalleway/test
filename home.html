            <h2>Around Pawnee</h2>
            <p>The world-building of Parks and Rec is part of what makes Pawnee so lovable and (almost) realistic. The locations frequented around become synonymous with who our characters are and are the setting for some of the most memorable scenes in the show.</p>

            <p>Over the course of the show's run, the Parks Department took on multiple projects across Pawnee in hopes to make the town a better place. Though never easy, and always accompanied with pushback from residents, these memorable town events were cornerstones for the show.</p>
